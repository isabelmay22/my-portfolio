<h1>Izzy's favourite films</h1>
<h2>My top 3 films of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This is no1 as I love the soundtrack and I love the hobbits</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Panda 1 & 2</h3>
<p>These are some of my fave films because I think they are really funny</p>
<h3>Harry Potter series</h3>
<p>because who doesn't love HP<br />
HP is the best<br />
especially film 4<br />
but the audio books are better</p>
